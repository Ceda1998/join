          Welcome to the help page for Join, your guide to using our kanban
          project management tool. Here, we'll provide an overview of what Join
          is, how it can benefit you, and how to use it.
        </p>
        <h2>What is Join?</h2>
        <p>
          Join is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a
          group of dedicated students as part of their web development bootcamp at
          the Developer Akademie. Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is
          a highly effective method to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and
          maximize efficiency (or flow). Join leverages the principles of kanban
          to help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual
          interface. It is important to note that Join is designed as an
          educational exercise and is not intended for extensive business usage.
          While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot
          guarantee consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, or other
          aspects of quality regarding Join.

        <h2>How to use it</h2>
        <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use Join:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>Exploring the Board</h3>
            <p>
              When you log in to Join, you'll find a default board. This board
              represents your project and contains four default lists: "To Do",
              "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Creating Contacts</h3>
            <p>
              In Join, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to
              the "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill in the
              required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned
              tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Adding Cards</h3>
            <p>
              Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards.
              Cards represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the
              appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in
              the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Moving Cards</h3>
            <p>
              As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on
              the board by dragging and dropping the card from one list to
              another.
